# Personal Passion Project
As a third-year student at Devine, I get the opportunity to create my own Personal Passion Project.

## The Ship of Morse
This is a multi-player game for children between the ages of 8 and 12 years old. 
The goal is to get the ship to an island where they can open a treasure. 
It is up to the players to communicate in morse code so that the ship achieves its destination.
